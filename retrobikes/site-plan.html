      <h3>Quality Parts and Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        We believe to give the very best for our clients. That is why we only use original parts and equipment for the bikes. Also known as OEM or Original Equipment Manufacturer. You can get a lot of benefits by using original parts. For some, only using original parts is the key to keeping their motorcycle running smoothly. They even believe buying used motorcycle parts is better, as long as they are OEM. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you’re happy with your motorcycle and trust the brand, taking your bike to the dealership for repairs for OEM parts can give you confidence. And that is what we provide here. You don’t need to worry about performance or whether the part you are replacing will work. Because the dealership will simply replace the damaged or worn-out part with a brand new one made by the same manufacturer, you’re assured the same level of quality. And the good thing of having original parts on your bikes is it is backed with warranty. That is why most of the customers are willing to pay an extra so that they will be guaranteed that it is a quality product and has warranty.
